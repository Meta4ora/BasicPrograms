Functions:

1.Count the number of negative elements of a one-dimensional array of real numbers.

2. Calculate the sum of squares of positive elements of a one-dimensional array of real numbers.
3. 
4.calculate the sum of squares of negative elements of a one-dimensional array of real numbers.

5. Convert a one-dimensional array of real numbers by assigning each element the square of its value.
6. 
7.transform a one-dimensional array of real numbers, reducing each element by the absolute value of the average value of the array elements.

8.transform a one-dimensional array of real numbers by entering the sum of all previous elements into each element (in this case, the value 0 must be placed in the first element).

9.calculate the sum of the squares of the diagonal elements of a two-dimensional array of real numbers.

10.calculate the maximum sum of elements in the rows of a two-dimensional array of real numbers.

11.calculate the minimum sum of elements in the columns of a two-dimensional array of real numbers.

12. Convert a two-dimensional array of real numbers by putting the value 0 in all elements with two even indices.
